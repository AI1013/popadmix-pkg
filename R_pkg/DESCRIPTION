Description: A package to calculate heterozygosity, Fst and make plots. You can use this package to calculate the 
    heterozygosity of a population at a locus. Also it can calculate diferent Fst, like between population 1 and 
    population 2, or between a founder population and the admixed population for the K=2 founder population case
    or the general case of K founding population. You can use it to produce the related plots in the paper.
